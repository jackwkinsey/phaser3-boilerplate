# Phaser 3 Boilerplate

This is a super simple starter setup for new Phaser 3 projects. Webpack is used for bundling Phaser and game code together.

A very simple scene is setup and ready to be hacked on, but the main benefit is having Webpack configured and running.

## Using the project

Simply clone the repo to your machine and run

`npm install`

You may then run

`npm run start-dev`

to fire up the Webpack development server.

### Happy Hacking!
